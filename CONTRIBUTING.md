# Contributing to Event–Invariant Language (EIL)

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

EIL is a **small, conservative specification**. Contributions are welcome, but the bar for change is intentionally high.

The goal is not feature growth — it is **clarity, stability, and correctness**.

---

## What This Project Is

EIL is:
- an intent-level specification
- designed to preserve meaning across human–AI collaboration
- intentionally minimal
- grammar-stable within major versions

---

## What This Project Is Not

EIL is not:
- a framework
- a programming language
- an SDK
- a task runner
- a description of model internals

Proposals that move EIL toward those directions are unlikely to be accepted.

---

## Types of Contributions Welcome

### ✔ Clarifications
- Improving wording without changing meaning
- Making boundaries more explicit
- Reducing ambiguity or redundancy

### ✔ Examples
- New examples demonstrating correct EIL usage
- Verification or execution-handoff patterns
- Clear, minimal, real-world cases

### ✔ Documentation
- README improvements
- Better explanations of intent or non-goals
- Cross-linking between sections

---

## Types of Contributions That Require Discussion

Please open an issue **before** submitting a PR for:

- Grammar changes
- New core fields
- Semantic reinterpretations
- Anything that would require a version bump

---

## Ground Rules

- The **Markdown spec (`SPEC.md`) is canonical**
- `.docx` files are exports only
- Backward compatibility matters
- If intent is unclear, ask — do not infer

---

## How to Propose Changes

1. Open an issue describing:
   - the problem
   - the ambiguity or limitation
   - why existing rules are insufficient
2. Include concrete examples.
3. Be explicit about whether the change is:
   - clarification
   - extension
   - or semantic change

---

## Philosophy

EIL values:
- correctness over cleverness
- stability over expressiveness
- explicitness over inference

If a proposal makes EIL larger but not clearer, it is probably the wrong direction.

Thank you for helping keep EIL small, sharp, and useful.
